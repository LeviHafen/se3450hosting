        <h1>Levi Hafen</h1>
        <p>I am from St. George, Utah. I come from a blended family consisting of three large families, resulting in a total of 13 siblings. Among them, I have four biological sisters, and the remaining are step-siblings. Growing up in such a diverse family has taught me the value of unity and understanding.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in outdoor activities. Whether it's hitting the slopes for a snowboarding session, exploring new hiking trails, or spending weekends camping under the stars, I find solace and joy in the beauty of nature.</p>
